export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

<Image src={mushroomImage} alt="mushroom on a log" />

Should I just use the Context API? Maybe lift my state up to a common ancestor? Or maybe I could use something like Zustand?

"I just want to use a hook to manage state between components. I know I can use Zustand for this but isn't that overkill?"

I heard this question recently, and the answer is no, it's not overkill at all.

Zustand is a great way to share state between components. It's easy to use, and it's easy to understand.

This is a store in Zustand:

```jsx
import create from 'zustand'
import { SetState } from 'zustand'

type FrogStore = {
  isRaining: boolean,
  toggleRain: () => void,
}

const useFrogStore = create((set: SetState<FrogStore>) => ({
  isRaining: false,
  toggleRain: () => set((state) => ({ isRaining: !state.isRaining })),
}))
```

Pretty straightforward.

You use the `create` function to create a store. The store is just a function that takes a `set` argument.

The `set` argument is a function that takes a callback. The callback is passed the current state and returns the new state.

You can use this store in any component you want.

Let's say you have a frog and a mushroom. The frog likes to hide under the mushroom when it rains.

Here's how you can easily share state between two components using your Zustand store 🐸🍄:

```jsx
const Frog = () => {
  const isRaining = useFrogStore((state) => state.isRaining)
  const toggleRain = useFrogStore((state) => state.toggleRain)
  const frogStatus = isRaining
    ? 'hiding under the mushroom'
    : 'coming out to play'

  return (
    <>
      <h1>The frog is {frogStatus}.</h1>
      <button onClick={toggleRain}>
        {isRaining ? 'Stop rain' : 'Start rain'}
      </button>
    </>
  )
}

const Mushroom = () => {
  const isRaining = useFrogStore((state) => state.isRaining)
  return <h1>{isRaining ? 'The mushroom is wet.' : 'The mushroom is dry.'}</h1>
}

const App = () => (
  <>
    <Frog />
    <Mushroom />
  </>
)
```

No need to wrap the components in a provider, or pass state props around.

Wins across the board!

Zustand is also one of the smallest state management libraries with a bundle size of just 1.16kb. **It's in no way overkill.**

If you want to gain a deeper understanding of how a library like Zustand works, I recommend you check out this course by Daishi Kato, [where you build your own Zustand-like state library](https://egghead.io/courses/create-a-zustand-like-module-state-library-bf55241e)
